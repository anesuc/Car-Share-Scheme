# Car Share Scheme

The objective of this project is to implement our knowledge/skills to develop a
web/mobile car share scheme platform. This application will let users pick a
vehicle in a selected location (based on the userâ€™s location), and once the
user has finished using it, they can then return it to a nearest empty park
location. The platform will be designed to work within Melbourne (whilst
maintaining possible chances of expanding if necessary).
